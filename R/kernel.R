#' Compute and return a vector representation of a forest's leaf predictions for 
#' every observation in a dataset.
#' The vector has a "column-major" format that can be easily re-represented as 
#' as a CSC sparse matrix: elements are organized so that the first `n` elements 
#' correspond to leaf predictions for all `n` observations in a dataset for the 
#' first tree in an ensemble, the next `n` elements correspond to predictions for 
#' the second tree and so on. The "data" for each element corresponds to a uniquely 
#' mapped column index that corresponds to a single leaf of a single tree (i.e. 
#' if tree 1 has 3 leaves, its column indices range from 0 to 2, and then tree 2's 
#' leaf indices begin at 3, etc...).
#' Users may pass a single dataset (which we refer to here as a "training set") 
#' or two datasets (which we refer to as "training and test sets"). This verbiage 
#' hints that one potential use-case for a matrix of leaf indices is to define a 
#' ensemble-based kernel for kriging.
